2. I have written several test cases for the update user profile frontend module, 
   currently I have been writing cases for output partitioning. I have added several functions to controllers.py. 
3. Most difficulties include getting used to seleniumbase and getting used to/understanding how each command works.
4. Continue writing test cases for update user profile, frontend module,
   need to add test cases for 2 more kinds of BB testing. I also need to verify that the tests pass

2. So far I have totally fixed my backend test cases for createListing which have been a problem our group has dealt with 
   for a number of weeks, and have also started writing my front end black box test cases for ListingPage                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Currently I have a error with updating my local branch and due to this I've gone to office hours and I am currently exploring 
   different methods to try to fix it. Furthermore this may be the reason my branch will change and show that I have no commits 
   as one method may just be to make a new branch.                                 
4. For the days to come I plan on finishing my front end black box test cases for ListingPage
